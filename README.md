# Hyperledger Fabric Samples

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/Fabric-Samples/_apis/build/status/Fabric-Samples?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/Fabric-Samples/_build/latest?definitionId=28&branchName=main)

You can use Fabric samples to get started working with Hyperledger Fabric, explore important Fabric features, and learn how to build applications that can interact with blockchain networks using the Fabric SDKs. To learn more about Hyperledger Fabric, visit the [Fabric documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

## Getting started with the Fabric samples

To use the Fabric samples, you need to download the Fabric Docker images and the Fabric CLI tools. First, make sure that you have installed all of the [Fabric prerequisites](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html). You can then follow the instructions to [Install the Fabric Samples, Binaries, and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the Fabric documentation. In addition to downloading the Fabric images and tool binaries, the Fabric samples will also be cloned to your local machine.

## Test network

The [Fabric test network](test-network) in the samples repository provides a Docker Compose based test network with two
Organization peers and an ordering service node. You can use it on your local machine to run the samples listed below.
You can also use it to deploy and test your own Fabric chaincodes and applications. To get started, see
the [test network tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html).
